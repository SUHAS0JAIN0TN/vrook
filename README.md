Ashoke, a young budding _Travel Entrepeneur_, is quite saddened after incurring loss from past several trips.

He gets an offer from one of the travel agencies to carry out a trip. Ashoke is lit! This is his first venture towards making a profit.

Travel agency provides Ashoke the distances between every pair of locations he needs to cover. He can start and end at any two (different) locations he wants, but he must make sure that he takes travellers to visit each location exactly once.

Now, help Ashoke to maximize his profits by suggesting him the shortest distance he can travel to achieve this?

For example, given the following distances:

`Bangalore to Hubli` = 464
<br />
`Bangalore to Goa` = 518
<br />
`Hubli to Davanagere` = 141
<br />

The possible routes are:

Hubli -> Bangalore -> Davanagere = 982
<br />
Bangalore -> Hubli -> Davanagere = 605
<br />
Bangalore -> Davanagere -> Hubli = 659
<br />
Hubli -> Davanagere -> Bangalore = 659
<br />
Davanagere -> Hubli -> Bangalore = 605
<br />
Davanagere -> Bangalore -> Hubli = 982
<br />
<br />

The shortest path here is `Bangalore -> Hubli -> Davanagere = 605`, so the answer is `605` for this example.

Help Ashoke! Find the input file in the repository.
